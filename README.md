# Text-Classification-Analysis

This project focuses on building a complete Text Classification workflow using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to transform raw text data into meaningful insights by training models that can accurately classify text into predefined categories.

## Project Overview

This analysis includes:

- Importing and exploring the dataset

- Cleaning and preprocessing text

- Tokenization, stemming/lemmatization, and stopword removal

- Feature extraction using TF-IDF

- Training and evaluating multiple machine learning models

- Comparing performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices

## Techniques & Tools

- Python

- Pandas, NumPy

- Scikit-learn

- NLTK / spaCy

- Matplotlib / Seaborn

- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Insights

The models were able to identify meaningful patterns in the text, showing which words and features most influenced classification accuracy. Performance comparison helped determine the most effective algorithm for this dataset.
